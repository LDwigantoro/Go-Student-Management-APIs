The Clean Architecture approach to software design emphasizes separating the different concerns of an application, such as the business logic, user interface, and data access, into distinct layers or components. In Go, this can be achieved by using interfaces to define the contracts between different layers and using dependency injection to create loose coupling between them.

This repository is an example of a Go project that uses clean architecture, which is a simple API for managing collage student. The project is organized into the following layers:

* entities 
* repository
* usecases 
* delivery
<!-- The entities package contains the domain model for the application, including the Todo struct that represents a single todo item.
The usecases package contains the business logic for the application, including the TodoInteractor struct that defines the operations that can be performed on todo items.
The delivery package contains the user interface for the application, including the TodoHandler struct that defines the HTTP endpoints for the API.
The repository package contains the data access logic for the application, including the TodoRepository interface that defines the methods for storing and retrieving todo items from a database.
Each of these layers is isolated from the others and only depends on the layers below it in the architecture. For example, the TodoHandler depends on the TodoInteractor but not directly on the TodoRepository. This makes it easy to test the different components of the application in isolation and also allows for flexibility in how the application is implemented.
